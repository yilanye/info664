**Oscar Winners of 2011-2020**

In this project, I used the data of The Oscar Award, 1927 - 2020 [the_oscar_award.csv], and Movie Database (IMDB Alternative)
(https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative?endpoint=apiendpoint_4585dc5d-1e30-478f-af65-4ea2bc5357a3)
 to make visualizations of Oscar winners of 2011-2020 sorted by the number of Oscars and the IMDB rating. Those two variables both could give a movie certain qualification, and therefore the visualizations I created can provide the overall ranking of these films won the Oscar.

Step 1: Run [winner.py]

Step 2: Create a new file, OSCAR - 2010-2020ID.csv, based on the Oscar Winner Information from Step1.

Step 3: Run [IMDBapi.py]

Step 4: Make the visualiztion with the file, Academy_Awards.json.

The visualiztions can be found through (https://public.tableau.com/views/OscarWinnersof2011-2020/OscarWinnersof2011-2020?:embed=y&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link).
